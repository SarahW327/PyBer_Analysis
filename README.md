Differences along this final result was each city does not have the same amount of people and does not have the same amount of drivers of each type of city. 
### Summary

- Target marketing towards Rural and Suburban areas.
- Either increase the fare rates for rural and suburban areas or decrease the fare rates for urban areas.
- Hiring more drivers in Rural and Suburban areas or cutting down the amount of drivers in Urban areas.
